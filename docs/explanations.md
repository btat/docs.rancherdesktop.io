title: Explanations
---

Explanation docs are concerned primarily with providing theoretical knowledge for the "why" behind a task or a topic. Explanations are "understanding-oriented" in nature and will clarify a topic in order to broaden the user's knowledge. In this section, users can find additional context and background, alternatives or even opinions on topics, and often historical reasons, constraints, and insights into why a process works the way that it does.

Explanatory docs do not instruct the user how to do something, as in tutorials and how-to guides, nor do they give detailed descriptions as references do. Explanations serve to give substance and background on both simple and complex topics.

For our new docs, we are working to build up this section as most of our previous documentation was process-oriented rather than discussion-oriented. 

Good examples of Rancher explanatory documentation might be knowledge-based articles, [blogs](https://www.suse.com/c/rancherblog/[), and even [recorded knowledge-transfer sessions](https://web.microsoftstream.com/group/a3942832-550c-46fc-8e77-411621bf4473).
