Rancher is a container management platform built for organizations that deploy containers in production. Rancher makes it easy to run Kubernetes everywhere, meet IT requirements, and empower DevOps teams.

### Run Kubernetes Everywhere

Kubernetes has become the container orchestration standard. Most cloud and virtualization vendors now offer it as standard infrastructure. Rancher users have the choice of creating Kubernetes clusters with Rancher Kubernetes Engine (RKE) or cloud Kubernetes services, such as GKE, AKS, and EKS. Rancher users can also import and manage their existing Kubernetes clusters created using any Kubernetes distribution or installer.

### Meet IT Requirements

Rancher supports centralized authentication, access control, and monitoring for all Kubernetes clusters under its control. For example, you can:

- Use your Active Directory credentials to access Kubernetes clusters hosted by cloud vendors, such as GKE.
- Setup and enforce access control and security policies across all users, groups, projects, clusters, and clouds.
- View the health and capacity of your Kubernetes clusters from a single-pane-of-glass.
