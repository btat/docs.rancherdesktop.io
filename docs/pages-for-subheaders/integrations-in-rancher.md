title: Integrations in Rancher
---

Over time, Rancher has accrued several products and projects that have been integrated into the Rancher UI. To assist users in learning more about these integrations as well as how they function in the Rancher UI, this section has been dedicated to them. 

These docs are geared toward both new and existing Rancher users and provide detailed descriptions of the products as well as how they work within the Rancher UI. The purpose of these docs is to provide users what the product is and does, how it works at a high level, some prodecural steps to installing and using the product, and why it enhances the Rancher user experience.

Examples of some of these integrations are [Harvester](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/virtualization-admin/) and [NeuVector](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/neuvector-integration/).
