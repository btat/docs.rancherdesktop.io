title: Introduction
---

This section includes a high-level [overview](../docs/getting-started/introduction/overview.md) of the Rancher Manager product and an introduction to the [Divio documentation paradigm in Rancher](../docs/getting-started/introduction/what-are-divio-docs.md).

The new Rancher Manager docs will build upon the content and depth of the original Rancher documentation through a simpler and more streamlined organizational layout derived from [Divio](https://documentation.divio.com/).
