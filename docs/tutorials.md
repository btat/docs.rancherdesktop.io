Tutorials describe practical steps for users to follow in order to complete some concrete action. Tutorials are known as "learning-oriented" docs in which users learn by "doing".

Tutorials are designed to guide beginners, or the everyday users of a product, through a series of steps to learn how to do something. The goal is that the user will be able to learn how to complete tasks by using easy-to-follow, meaningful, and repeatable directions. Good tutorials should assist new and existing users to do work to then get the promised results immediately.

It should be noted that tutorials do not provide detailed explanations on "why" something is done; the impetus is placed upon "how" to do some task. 

The average Rancher user has a level of technical skill that is above the level of "beginner"; however, the new Rancher tutorials are designed to help new, or beginner, users as well as the seasoned Rancher customer equally. This is accomplished by using a combination of high-level and technical language to introduce topics and guide the user through general tasks that are essential for every Rancher user to know.

A good example of a Rancher tutorial can be found [here](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/installation/resources/k8s-tutorials/infrastructure-tutorials/infra-for-ha/).
