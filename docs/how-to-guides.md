title: How-to Guides
---

How-to guides serve to describe practical steps for users to accomplish some task. In Rancher, we break down how-to guides further into [new user guides](#new-user-guides) and [advanced user guides](#advanced-user-guides).

### New User Guides 

New user guides, also known as tutorials, describe practical steps for users to follow in order to complete some concrete action. These docs are known as "learning-oriented" docs in which users learn by "doing".

The new user guides are designed to guide beginners, or the everyday users of Rancher, through a series of steps to learn how to do something. The goal is that the user will be able to learn how to complete tasks by using easy-to-follow, meaningful, and repeatable directions. These guides will assist users to do work to then get the promised results immediately.

The average Rancher user has a level of technical skill that is above the level of "beginner"; however, the new user guides are designed to help new, or beginner, users as well as the seasoned Rancher customer equally. This is accomplished by using a combination of high-level and technical language to introduce topics and guide the user through general tasks that are essential for every Rancher user to know.

A good example of a new user guide can be found [here](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/k8s-in-rancher/workloads/deploy-workloads/).

### Advanced User Guides

Advanced user guides are "problem-oriented" docs in which users learn how to answer questions or solve problems. The major difference between these and the new user guides is that these guides are geared toward more experienced or advanced users who have more technical needs from their documentation. These users already have an understanding of Rancher and its functions. They know what they need to accomplish; they just need additional guidance to complete some more complex task they they have encountered while working.

It should be noted that neither new user guides nor advanced user guides provide detailed explanations or discussions (these kinds of docs belong elsewhere). How-to guides focus on the action of guiding users through repeatable, effective steps to learn new skills, master some task, or overcome some problem.
