title: How-to Guides
---

How-to guides are similar to [Tutorials](#tutorials) in that they also serve to describe practical steps for users to accomplish some task. How-to guides are "problem-oriented" docs in which users learn how to answer questions or solve problems. The major difference is that how-to guides are geared toward more experienced or advanced users who have more technical needs from their documentation. These users already have an understanding of Rancher and its functions and need additional guidance to complete some more complex task.

How-to guides also provide a series of detailed steps that will guide the experienced user to achieve a practical goal. Rancher users who will utilize how-to guides already know what they should achieve but just need help to learn how; conversely, tutorials teach the user both what they should know and how to achieve those results. 

It should be noted that how-to guides, like tutorials, do not provide detailed explanations or discussions. How-to guides focus on the action of guiding users through repeatable, effective steps.

A good example of a Rancher how-to guide can be found [here](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/cluster-admin/volumes-and-storage/provisioning-new-storage/).
