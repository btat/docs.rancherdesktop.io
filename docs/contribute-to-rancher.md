title: Contribute to Rancher
---

The Rancher Manager documentation is always a work-in-progress; the docs work best when being constantly examined, updated, and improved upon. To do this more effectively, we call upon the community to assist us.

The **Contribute to Rancher** section will instruct users on the repositories used for Rancher, how to build the repositories, and what information is needed when filing an issue or creating a pull request. 

We review all contributions frequently and will provide feedback to contributors promptly.
