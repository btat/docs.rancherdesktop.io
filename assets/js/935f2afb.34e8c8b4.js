However, there are use cases where, the ability to create a multi node cluster or spin up multiple clusters with flexibilty to switch between clusters is required. Eventhough Rancher Desktop doesn\'t have in-built multi node/cluster functionality, you can use k3d with Rancher Desktop to accomplish the same. k3d is a lightweight wrapper to run k3s (a minimal Kubernetes distribution, which is used by Rancher Desktop as well) in docker. k3d makes it very easy to create single- and multi-node k3s clusters in docker, e.g. for local development on Kubernetes.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"how-to-guides/hello-world-example":{"id":"how-to-guides/hello-world-example","title":"Hello World Example","description":"This tutorial will demonstrate how to get started with Rancher Desktop by pushing an app to a local Kubernetes cluster.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"how-to-guides/increasing-open-file-limit":{"id":"how-to-guides/increasing-open-file-limit","title":"Increasing Open File Limit","description":"You may wish to increase the open file limit as Rancher Desktop\'s default ulimit setting for pods may be too low, depending on your use case.
